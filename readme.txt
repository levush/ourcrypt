It feels to me that truecrypt has been taken over by the dark side.
In order to bless the world with the old, hopefully untainted sources
I started this repository to encourage you to further develop truecrypt.
Most important action item will be to insure that the code here is 
authentic. I guess it is, but I am not sure.

Also at least the windows version needs a screen keyboard to type the 
passphrase while the keys move every type like puzzle game. Also it needs
to use a low radiation "low pass" font to counter measure tempest attacks.
Because the one can be pretty sure, that a target's windows pc is infected 
with a keylogger. Even with linux one can not be sure, but it is less likely.

Thats all for the moment.

===============================================================================
Now for the kishkes:


I did Havdalah now, and it is time to fork truecrypt.
I will call it ourcrypt.org, since strong trustwothy cryptography should 
belong to us. So it is ourcrypt. I did this because truecrypt has a trade mark
 so changing/improving on it needs to make a fork with a different name.
I chose ourcrypt.org to be a new web side for the fork of truecrypt.
